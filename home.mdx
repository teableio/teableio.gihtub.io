Teable is a powerful visual interface built on relational databases (PostgreSQL).

It uses a simple, spreadsheet-like interface to create complex enterprise-level database applications. Unlock efficient app development with no code, free from data security and scalability hurdles. You can think of it as migrating the powerful capabilities of Airtable onto PostgreSQL while inheriting exceptional performance and stability from the physical databases.

## Why Teable?

No-code tools have significantly speed up how we get things done, allowing non-tech users to build amazing apps and changing the way many work and live. People like using spreadsheet-like UI to handle their data because it's easy, flexible, and great for team collaboration. They also prefer designing their app screens without being stuck with clunky templates.

Giving non-techy people the ability to create their software sounds exciting. But that's just the start:

* As businesses expand, their data needs intensify. No one wishes to hear that once their orders reach 100k, they'll outgrow their current interface. Yet, many no-code platforms falter at such scales.

* Most no-code platforms are cloud-based. This means your important data sits with the provider, and switching to another platform can be a headache.

* Sometimes, no-code tools can't do what you want because of their limitations, leaving users stuck.

* If a tool becomes essential, you'll eventually need some tech expertise. But developers often find these platforms tricky.

* Maintaining systems with complex setups can be hard for developers, especially if these aren't built using common software standards.

* Systems that don't use these standards might need revamping or replacing, costing more in the long run. It might even mean ditching the no-code route and going back to traditional coding.

#### What we think the future of no-code products look like

* An interface that anyone can use to build applications easily.

* Easy access to data, letting users grab, move, and reuse their information as they wish.

* Data privacy and choice, whether that's in the cloud, on-premise, or even just on your local.

* It needs to work for developers too, not just non-tech users.

* It should handle lots of data, so it can grow with your business.

* Flexibility to integrate with other software, combining strengths to get the job done.

* Last, native AI integration to takes usability to the next level.

In essence, Teable isn't just another no-code solution, it's a comprehensive answer to the evolving demands of modern software development, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their technical proficiency, has a platform tailored to their needs.
