# Grid View

#### Introduction

The Grid View is the default view type created when you create a new table in Teable. This view type comes closest to the traditional spreadsheet experience, yet the capabilities of Grid View extend far beyond that. This article will delve into all aspects of Grid View.

#### Creating a Grid View

As mentioned at the beginning, a Grid View is automatically created as the default whenever a new table is created. Thus, every time you add a new table, the system automatically creates a Grid View for it. To create a new Grid View in an existing table, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your workspace, then select the database, and finally choose the table where you want to add a new Grid View.
2. Click on the “View” option near the top left side of the screen. This opens the view sidebar. In some tables, the view sidebar may already be open, in which case you can proceed to the next step.
3. Find the “Grid+” option under the “Create...” section and click it.
4. This opens a popup window where you can name your new Grid View and set the view’s editing permissions (collaborative, personal, or locked).
5. After configuring these settings, click “Create New View.”
6. Now, you can further configure your view by hiding fields, filtering records, grouping records, sorting records, etc.

#### Adjusting Row Height in Grid View

By default, Grid View displays records with shorter row heights, aiming to maximize record density. With the shorter row height setting, each record displays one line of text and small-sized attachment thumbnails. If you wish to see more text and larger images, you can adjust the row height from the default short setting.

There are four different options for row height:

* Short (the most compact option and the default height for new views)
* Medium
* Tall
* Extra Tall (the most spacious option)

To change the row height in the current view, click on the row height toggler in the view bar and select the desired row height.

Shorter row heights allow you to see more records at once, while larger row heights let you see more information in each record. Specifically, larger row heights display multiple lines of text in text fields, multiple lines in linked records, multiple select field options, collaborator fields, and larger images.

Changing the row height does not affect the height of the field titles, which remain unadjustable.

If you wish to ensure your preferred row height setting is not accidentally changed, you can lock the view (coming soon), which prevents all collaborators from changing the view’s configuration until someone with creator permissions unlocks it.

#### Hiding Fields in Grid View

To hide (or show hidden) fields in Grid View, click on the “Hide Fields” button in the view bar to open the hide fields dialog. If there are no hidden fields in the current view, the “Hide Fields” button will appear as an eye icon with a line through it and display “Hide Fields.”

If there are hidden fields in the current view, the “Hide Fields” button will have a blue background and (if the window is wide enough) display the number of hidden fields, e.g., “12 hidden fields.”

When the hide fields dialog is open, you can see which fields are being shown (toggle switch green and moved to the right) and which are hidden (toggle switch grey and moved to the left).

Click on the toggle switch next to a field name to hide or show that field.

“Hide All” and “Show All” buttons allow you to quickly hide/show all fields (except the primary field, which cannot be hidden).

If you have many fields, you can enter a search term in the “Find Field” search box to more easily find the field you’re looking for.

Another way to hide fields is by clicking on a field title and selecting the “Hide Field” option from the dropdown menu.

You can also hide or show individual fields in Grid View by opening the expand record.

#### Reordering Fields in Grid View

You can quickly rearrange the order of fields in the view by clicking and dragging the drag handle on top of the field names.

Fields can also be directly moved by clicking and dragging the field titles within the Grid View itself.

Fields cannot be reordered within the expand record view.

#### Wrapping Text in Individual Cells

By default, new Grid Views display rows at a fixed height in a single line. However, by expanding the row height, fields containing text will wrap to the next line.

Shorter row heights allow you to see more records at once, while larger row heights let you see more information in each record. Specifically, larger row heights display multiple lines of text in text fields, multiple lines in linked records, multiple select field options, collaborator fields, and larger images.

To expand a single row at a time, you can press the space bar while any cell in the selected row is focused.

You can also click on a cell to view the full contents of the current cell, then use the arrow keys to quickly move between different cells.
